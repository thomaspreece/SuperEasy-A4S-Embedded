// ARTK  machine.cpp 
// A pre-emptive multitasking kernel for Arduino
//
// History:
// Release 0.1  June 2012  Paul H. Schimpf
// Release 0.2  June 2012  Paul H. Schimpf
//              Some changes to squeeze out bits of memory
//
// Acknowledgement:
// Thank you to Raymond J. A. Buhr and Donald L. Bailey for inspiration
// and ideas from "An Introduction to Real-Time Systems."  While there are 
// significant differences, there are also similarities in the structure 
// and implementation of ARTK and Tempo.

// Usage Notes:
// ARTK makes use of the Arduino TimerOne library, which is distributed with it.
// You must NOT implement a setup() function
// Implement a Setup() function instead - ARTK will call it for you
// You must NOT implement a loop() function
// Implement a Main() function instead, which will be the lowest priority task
// See the file ARTKtest.ino for example usage 
 
// ARDUINO (AVR) Machine Code
// AVR stack grows downward in memory
// SP points to next free location (post decr on push, pre incr on pop)
// Low byte of ret addr goes on first (at the higher addr)
//
#include  <Arduino.h> 
#include "machine.h"

// perform a context switch
// firstRun is true when the incoming task is being run for the first time
void ContextSwitch(unsigned char **fromSP, unsigned char *toSP, int firstRun)

   // push registers to exiting process stack
