// ARTK  machine.h 
// A pre-emptive multitasking kernel for Arduino
//
// History:
// Release 0.1  June 2012  Paul H. Schimpf
// Release 0.2  June 2012  Paul H. Schimpf
//              Some changes to squeeze out bits of memory
//
// Acknowledgement:
// Thank you to Raymond J. A. Buhr and Donald L. Bailey for inspiration
// and ideas from "An Introduction to Real-Time Systems."  While there are 
// significant differences, there are also similarities in the structure 
// and implementation of ARTK and Tempo.

// Usage Notes:
// ARTK makes use of the Arduino TimerOne library, which is distributed with it.
// You must NOT implement a setup() function
// Implement a Setup() function instead - ARTK will call it for you
// You must NOT implement a loop() function
// Implement a Main() function instead, which will be the lowest priority task
// See the file ARTKtest.ino for example usage 
 
#ifndef MACHINE_H
#define MACHINE_H

// these are machine dependent functions that use inline assembly - 
// see machine.cpp
