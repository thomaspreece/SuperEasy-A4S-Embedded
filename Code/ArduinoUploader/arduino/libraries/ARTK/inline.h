// A pre-emptive multitasking kernel for Arduino
//
// History:
// Release 0.2  June 2012  Paul H. Schimpf
//              Some changes to squeeze out bits of memory
//
// Acknowledgement:
// Thank you to Raymond J. A. Buhr and Donald L. Bailey for inspiration
// and ideas from "An Introduction to Real-Time Systems."  While there are 
// significant differences, there are also similarities in the structure 
// and implementation of ARTK and Tempo.
